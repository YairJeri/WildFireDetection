# Wildfire Risk Prediction via Image Processing

This project implements a custom image processing pipeline to predict areas at risk of wildfires from satellite images. The focus is on preprocessing satellite images, texture detection, and vegetation analysis for automatic classification.

---

## Dataset

The project uses satellite images from the [Wildfire Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset/data), which includes:

- **Classes:** `Wildfire` (areas where a wildfire occurred) and `No wildfire`.
- **Image format:** JPEG, 350x350 pixels.
- **Number of images:** ~22,710 wildfire and ~20,140 no wildfire images.
- **Example images:**

Image tag as `Wildfire`:

Image tag as `No wildfire`:

## Image Processing Model

This notebook demonstrates an image processing approach for predicting wildfire-prone areas. The workflow includes:

1. **Color space conversion:** Convert RGB images to HSV for better segmentation of vegetation.
2. **Contrast enhancement:** Histogram equalization of the Value channel to improve terrain visibility.
3. **Texture detection:** Apply Laplacian filter + binary masks to highlight areas with significant textures.
4. **Green mask & Green Leaf Index (GLI):** Identify regions dominated by vegetation.
5. **Contour filtering:** Filter relevant contours based on:
   - Minimum area
   - Aspect ratio
   - Fill ratio
   - Circularity
6. **Classification:** Images with significant contours are classified as `Wildfire`.

This approach demonstrates how classical image processing techniques can be applied for early wildfire detection using satellite imagery.

## Results

Using a test set, the image processing model achieved:

| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Accuracy  | 0.83  |
| Precision | 0.84  |
| Recall    | 0.85  |
| F1 Score  | 0.84  |

These results show that even without deep learning, image processing can provide meaningful wildfire risk predictions.

## Process example

The following example demonstrates the image processing pipeline for predicting wildfire-prone areas.

### 0. Original image

![Original Image](example/original_image.png)

### 1. Color space conversion

Convert RGB images to HSV for better segmentation of vegetation and equalization of the Value channel to improve terrain visibility.

### 2. Texture detection

Apply Laplacian filter + binary masks to highlight areas with significant textures.

### 3. Green mask

Identify regions dominated by green color.

### 4. Green Leaf Index (GLI)

Calculate the Green Leaf Index (GLI) for each region.

![GLI](example/gli.png)

And create a mask upon certain threshold.

### 5. Combine masks and apply contour filtering

Combine the masks.

![Combined Mask](example/combined_mask.png)

And apply contour filtering to identify areas with significant contours.

![Final Mask](example/final_mask.png)

### 6. Classification

Classify the image as `Wildfire` if the final mask is non-zero.

![Result](example/result.png)

In this example, the image is classified as `Wildfire` due to the presence of significant contours.
